# aipotluck-local-client — Architecture Plan

Status: PLANNING (not yet implemented). This doc captures findings from
examining llama.cpp's install methods and proposes how we wrap it.

## 1. What llama.cpp actually gives us to wrap

llama.cpp has **no unified installer script**. `docs/install.md` lists four
paths, none of which is "run this script":

| Method      | Win | Mac | Linux | Notes |
|-------------|-----|-----|-------|-------|
| conda-forge | Y   | Y   | Y     | needs conda/mamba/pixi already present |
| winget      | Y   |     |       | Windows only |
| Homebrew    |     | Y   | Y (linuxbrew) | needs brew already present |
| Nix         |     | Y   | Y     | niche |
| build from source | Y | Y | Y | `cmake -B build && cmake --build build --config Release` |

All of the package-manager paths ultimately resolve to the same artifact:
GitHub Releases at `ggml-org/llama.cpp`, tagged `bNNNNN` (build number, not
semver). Each release publishes a flat archive per platform/backend, e.g.:

```
llama-b10989-bin-macos-arm64.tar.gz
llama-b10989-bin-macos-x64.tar.gz
llama-b10989-bin-ubuntu-x64.tar.gz
llama-b10989-bin-ubuntu-arm64.tar.gz
llama-b10989-bin-ubuntu-cuda-12.8-x64.tar.gz
llama-b10989-bin-ubuntu-vulkan-x64.tar.gz
llama-b10989-bin-ubuntu-rocm-10.0-x64.tar.gz
llama-b10989-bin-win-cpu-x64.zip
llama-b10989-bin-win-cuda-13.4-x64.zip
llama-b10989-bin-win-vulkan-x64.zip
llama-b10989-bin-win-cpu-arm64.zip
... (sycl, openvino, s390x, android, xcframework, cudart runtime bundles, ui)
```

Confirmed by extracting `llama-b10989-bin-ubuntu-x64.tar.gz`: it's a flat
directory — `llama-server`, `llama-cli`, `llama-quantize`, `llama-bench`, a
pile of `libggml-cpu-<arch feature level>.so` variants (dynamic CPU dispatch),
`libllama*.so`, `libmtmd.so`, `LICENSE`. No install script, no manifest. You
place it somewhere and run the binary directly with `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
pointing at the same dir (or keep binaries+libs colocated, which works
out-of-the-box on Linux/macOS via rpath, and via same-dir DLL search on
Windows).

**Conclusion:** "the llama.cpp installer" we stick close to is really just:
*download the right release asset for this OS/arch/backend, verify it,
extract it, keep it out of the way of user data*. That's exactly what brew's
formula and the winget manifest do under the hood. We replicate that logic
ourselves rather than shelling out to brew/winget, because:

- brew/winget/conda are not guaranteed present (chicken-and-egg for a
  cross-platform *installer*), and their presence/version drift is outside
  our control.
- Building from source requires a C++ toolchain we can't assume end users
  have — bad for "reduce friction."
- The GitHub Release binaries are the one path guaranteed on all three OSes
  with zero prerequisites beyond network access.

We keep an **escape hatch**: if the user already has `brew`/`winget`
available and prefers system-managed installs, offer `--via brew` /
`--via winget` flags that just shell out. Default path is our own
download+verify+extract, because it's the one we can make deterministic,
pinned, and offline-repeatable (cache the archive).

## 2. Version pinning strategy

- Pin a specific release tag (e.g. `b10989`) in a config file
  (`llama_version.json` at repo root), not "latest" — reproducibility.
- `scripts/update_llama_version.py` (later) bumps the pin deliberately.
- Submodule `vendor/llama.cpp` tracks source at that same tag for reference /
  future custom builds, but the installer does **not** build from the
  submodule by default — it downloads the matching prebuilt release. The
  submodule exists so we can (a) read server CLI flags/docs programmatically,
  (b) fall back to source build when no prebuilt asset matches the host
  (e.g. exotic Linux arch), (c) later carry patches if we ever need a custom
  build.

## 3. Installer wrapper design

```
aipotluck-local-client/
  vendor/llama.cpp/            # git submodule, pinned commit
  llama_version.json           # {"tag": "b10989", "assets": {...sha256s...}}
  aipotluck/                   # the root package -- see README.md's "Repo layout" for the full,
    installer/                 # current-state tree (this diagram predates the `aipotluck.` rename
      __init__.py               # and login/logout/status CLI; kept here for the original design
      platform_detect.py        # rationale, not as an up-to-date file listing).
      fetch.py                  # download+checksum+extract release asset
      layout.py                  # where things live on disk per-OS

  ARCHITECTURE.md
```

### 3.1 Platform/arch/backend detection (`platform_detect.py`)
- `platform.system()` → `Linux` / `Darwin` / `Windows`
- `platform.machine()` → normalize to `x64` / `arm64`
- GPU backend probe (best-effort, non-fatal if inconclusive):
  - NVIDIA: `nvidia-smi` present → cuda asset
  - AMD: `rocminfo` / `/dev/kfd` → rocm asset (Linux only for now)
  - Apple Silicon: Metal is built into the `macos-arm64` asset already (no
    separate variant) — nothing to detect, just pick macos-arm64.
  - Vulkan: generic fallback for non-NVIDIA/AMD GPU Linux/Windows if desired.
  - Default/no GPU detected → plain CPU asset (`ubuntu-x64`, `win-cpu-x64`,
    `macos-*`). CPU asset ships multiple `libggml-cpu-<isa>.so` variants and
    llama.cpp dynamically dispatches to the best one at runtime — so plain
    CPU asset is always a safe baseline even when GPU detection is wrong.
- Asset-name mapping table lives in `llama_version.json` so it's data, not
  code, and survives across version bumps without touching logic.

### 3.2 Fetch + verify (`fetch.py`)
- Download from `https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/releases/download/<tag>/<asset>`.
- Verify sha256 against `llama_version.json` (we compute and pin these
  ourselves at version-bump time — llama.cpp releases don't publish
  checksums, so we generate our own manifest and treat first-download-per-tag
  as trust-on-first-use, recorded for future audits).
- Extract to a versioned dir so multiple versions can coexist:
  `<install_root>/llama.cpp/<tag>/<platform-asset>/`.
- Idempotent: re-running with the same tag/asset is a no-op if already
  extracted and checksum matches.

### 3.2.1 When no prebuilt asset works: source build + our own binary cache

Not every host has a viable upstream release asset. `build_strategy.py` decides this per host --
two independent, confirmed-real triggers: no asset was ever published for the detected
os/arch/backend (every Jetson-class arm64+CUDA board -- `nvidia-smi` is real there, but llama.cpp's
release CI has never published a `linux-arm64-cuda` asset), or the best available asset needs a
newer glibc than the host has (llama.cpp's own CI builds its Linux arm64 assets against a newer
base image than most arm64 boards run -- the pinned tag's `linux-arm64-cpu` asset needs glibc 2.38,
JetPack 6.2.3 ships 2.35, so even the CPU-only fallback refuses to start there).

When that happens, three tiers are tried in order, each cheaper than the next:

1. **Our own binary cache** (`build_cache.py`, `llama_custom_builds.json`). Once a binary has been
   built from source for a given (os, arch, backend, GPU architecture) combination, there's no
   reason to pay a 30-90 minute compile again on every matching host -- it's archived in the same
   format as the upstream release assets (a `.tar.gz` extracting to a flat top-level directory,
   matching llama.cpp's own release packaging exactly) and hosted as a GitHub release on this
   project's own public repo. The manifest shape deliberately mirrors `llama_version.json`'s assets
   section (`release_base_url` + `tag` + `{key: {file, sha256}}`), so this reuses
   `fetch.download_asset`/`extract_archive`/`find_binary` completely unchanged -- only the key
   resolution differs. The key includes the CUDA architecture where upstream's never need to
   (`linux-arm64-cuda-sm87` for Orin, distinct from a hypothetical `-sm72` for Xavier or `-sm53` for
   the original Nano/TX1) -- a binary built for one `CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES` value will not run
   correctly on a different one, so these are never treated as interchangeable.
2. **Build from source** (`source_build.py`), when neither an upstream asset nor a cached custom
   one matches. Checks the host actually has what a build needs (cmake, git, a C++ compiler,
   OpenSSL headers, the OpenMP runtime, and per-backend a GPU vendor toolchain -- nvcc for CUDA,
   glslc+headers for Vulkan, hipcc for ROCm), cross-referenced against every Linux job in
   llama.cpp's own release CI rather than guessed from one host's missing package. For the
   apt-fixable gaps, the installer can install them itself via `sudo apt-get install`, but only
   with explicit consent (`--allow-apt-install`, or an interactive y/N prompt that never fires
   without a real controlling terminal) -- a GPU vendor toolchain is never auto-installed under any
   flag, since none of those are a small, safe, distro-generic install. Two build-time gotchas are
   the same shape (a plain, non-`REQUIRED` `find_package(...)` that degrades silently rather than
   failing the configure step): missing OpenSSL headers silently compile out HTTPS support (which
   `-hf`/`--cache-list`, and therefore this project's own pull/list commands, depend on), and
   missing libgomp1 silently falls back to single-threaded CPU inference. Both are caught in
   preflight, before ever starting a build that can otherwise take well over an hour on a low-power
   board. The build sets `CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH=$ORIGIN` (matching llama.cpp's own release CI)
   specifically so its output is relocatable -- movable into the binary cache above, or into a
   different install root -- rather than only working from the exact path it was compiled at.
3. Refuse clearly, if source-build prerequisites are missing and the caller declined
   (or was never asked, e.g. `--no-apt-install`/no terminal) to fix them, or `--no-source-build` was
   passed to fail fast rather than sit through a long build.

Confirmed end-to-end on a real Jetson Orin Nano (JetPack 6.2.3): the full pipeline (detection ->
strategy -> preflight -> source build) produced a genuinely working CUDA `llama-server`
(`--list-devices` reports `CUDA0: Orin`), and once cached, the same host skips the ~35 minute
compile entirely on a repeat install.

### 3.3 Install locations (`layout.py`), per OS, no-admin-by-default
- Linux: `~/.local/share/aipotluck/` (binaries+libs), config in
  `~/.config/aipotluck/`, logs in `~/.local/state/aipotluck/logs/`
  (XDG dirs).
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/aipotluck/`, logs in
  `~/Library/Logs/aipotluck/`.
- Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\aipotluck\` for binaries/config,
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\aipotluck\logs\`.
- A `--system` flag can later target machine-wide install paths
  (`/opt/aipotluck`, `/Library/Application Support`,
  `%ProgramData%\aipotluck`) for the real "system service" case, requiring
  elevation. Default stays per-user/no-admin to minimize friction, matching
  llama.cpp's own brew/winget UX (no admin prompt).

### 3.4 Top-level installer flow (`install.py`)
1. Detect platform/arch/backend.
2. Resolve asset name from `llama_version.json`.
3. Fetch+verify+extract llama.cpp release into versioned install dir.
4. Write/refresh a small `runtime.json` pointing at the resolved
   `llama-server` binary path + lib dir for this OS.
5. Install our Python service (section 4) pointed at that `runtime.json`.
6. Optionally start the service immediately (`--start` flag, default on).
7. Print a summary: install dir, service status, server URL
   (`http://127.0.0.1:8080` by default, matching llama.cpp's own default so
   we don't invent new conventions).

CLI surface (argparse, no exotic deps):
```
python -m aipotluck.installer.install [--tag b10989] [--backend auto|cpu|cuda|vulkan|rocm]
                             [--install-dir PATH] [--system] [--no-start]
                             [--via auto|direct|brew|winget]
```

## 4. Python service injection design

"Tack on our bare python service" after the llama.cpp install finishes.
Scope for now: **blank/no-op service** — just proves out the cross-platform
service lifecycle (install, autostart, start/stop/status, logs) so the real
transport layer has a place to live later. It should NOT try to manage
llama-server itself yet beyond optionally shelling out to start it — keep
concerns separated: llama.cpp does inference serving, our service is future
transport/orchestration surface.

### 4.1 Service abstraction
`aipotluck/installer/service/base.py` defines:
```python
class ServiceManager(ABC):
    def install(self, exec_path: str, args: list[str], name: str, user_scope: bool) -> None: ...
    def uninstall(self, name: str) -> None: ...
    def start(self, name: str) -> None: ...
    def stop(self, name: str) -> None: ...
    def status(self, name: str) -> ServiceStatus: ...
```
`install.py` picks the concrete implementation via `platform.system()`.

### 4.2 Linux — systemd user unit (default), system unit optional
- Default: `~/.config/systemd/user/aipotluck.service`, enabled with
  `systemctl --user enable --now aipotluck.service`. No root needed. Starts
  at user login (or with lingering enabled via
  `loginctl enable-linger $USER` for boot-time start without login — call
  this out explicitly, don't silently enable linger).
- `--system` flag: writes `/etc/systemd/system/aipotluck.service`, needs
  sudo, runs at boot regardless of login — this is the "real" system service
  case the user mentioned.
- Unit just runs `python3 <path>/aipotluck_service.py`; `Restart=on-failure`.

### 4.3 macOS — launchd
- Default (user/agent scope): plist at
  `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.aipotluck.service.plist`, loaded via
  `launchctl load -w`. Starts at login.
- `--system` flag: `LaunchDaemons` in `/Library/LaunchDaemons/`, needs sudo,
  starts at boot without login — the daemon-scope equivalent of a system
  service.
- `ProgramArguments` invokes the same python entrypoint; `KeepAlive` +
  `StandardOutPath`/`StandardErrorPath` for logs.

### 4.4 Windows — real Windows Service via `pywin32`, with a no-admin fallback
- True Windows Services need admin + a service wrapper. Use `pywin32`
  (`win32serviceutil`) — it's the standard, well-trodden path, pure Python,
  no extra native installer needed beyond the pip package.
- `pip install pywin32` as a dependency of the service component only
  (Linux/macOS installs don't need it).
- Default (no admin available / user declines UAC): fall back to a
  **Scheduled Task** (`schtasks /create /sc onlogon ...`) running the same
  script — no admin required, starts at logon, good enough for the "blank"
  phase.
- `--system` flag (requires elevation): registers as an actual Windows
  Service (`python aipotluck_service.py install` via pywin32's
  `win32serviceutil.HandleCommandLine`, then `sc config ... start= auto`) —
  runs at boot, no login required. This is the true system-service parity
  with systemd `--system` / launchd `LaunchDaemons`.

### 4.5 The "blank" service payload itself
`aipotluck/service/aipotluck_service.py`: minimal, dependency-free (stdlib only) for
now:
- A tiny loop / `http.server` health endpoint (`GET /healthz` → `200 ok`) so
  we have something externally observable and testable across all three
  service backends without needing the transport layer yet.
- Reads `runtime.json` written by the installer so it already knows where
  llama-server lives, in preparation for later orchestration duties, but
  does not start/stop llama-server yet in this phase — that wiring comes
  with the transport layer.
- Structured logging to the per-OS log dir from section 3.3.

## 4.5 The "always running" supervision layer (implemented)

`aipotluck/service/llama_supervisor.py` implements `LlamaSupervisor`, used by
`aipotluck/service/aipotluck_service.py`:

- On service start, spawns `llama-server` with args built from
  `runtime.json` (`--host`, `--port`, `--model`/`-hf`, `--ctx-size`,
  `--gpu-layers`).
- Polls `GET /health` on llama-server every 5s (`HEALTH_POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS`).
- On crash (process exit), restarts with exponential backoff
  (1/2/5/10/20/30/60s), resetting to the start of the schedule if the
  process had stayed up 2+ minutes (`STABLE_UPTIME_RESET_SECONDS`) --
  avoids hammering restarts on a persistently broken config while still
  recovering fast from transient crashes.
- On service shutdown (SIGTERM/SIGINT), terminates llama-server gracefully
  (SIGTERM, 15s grace period, then SIGKILL) before exiting.
- Exposes live state via `LlamaProcessInfo` (pid, running, healthy,
  restart_count, last_exit_code) surfaced at `GET /status` on the aipotluck
  service's own HTTP endpoint (port 8765).

Two-tier self-healing, confirmed by test:
1. systemd `Restart=always` / launchd `KeepAlive` / Windows Service restarts
   `aipotluck_service.py` itself if it dies.
2. `LlamaSupervisor` inside that process restarts just `llama-server` if
   *it* dies, without needing to restart the whole Python service.

Verified end-to-end on this repo's Linux/arm64 dev host: real model
download via llama-server's own `-hf` fetcher (bartowski/Qwen2.5-0.5B
default placeholder), health-check transition to healthy, live inference
request, `kill -9` on the llama-server child recovered automatically
(new pid, `restart_count` incremented, healthy again ~35s later), and
clean shutdown terminates both processes with no orphans.

## 4.6 Portability refactor: one service payload, three OS wrappers

To maximize code reuse across Linux/macOS/Windows, the service logic was
split into a layered, OS-agnostic core plus thin OS-specific entry points:

```
aipotluck/service/llama_supervisor.py   -- OS-agnostic: subprocess.Popen + polling (stdlib only)
aipotluck/service/runner.py             -- OS-agnostic: AipotluckServiceRunner
                                  (HTTP status server + supervisor lifecycle,
                                  exposes start()/stop()/wait(), no signal
                                  handling, no service-framework imports)
aipotluck/service/aipotluck_service.py  -- thin CLI wrapper: argparse + signal handlers
                                  around AipotluckServiceRunner. This exact
                                  script is what systemd, launchd, AND the
                                  Windows Scheduled Task (no-admin default)
                                  all invoke identically.
aipotluck/service/windows_service_host.py -- pywin32 ServiceFramework wrapper around
                                  the same AipotluckServiceRunner, used only
                                  for the Windows --system path (a true
                                  Windows Service needs SCM callbacks
                                  (SvcDoRun/SvcStop) instead of Unix signals)
```

This means ~95% of the runtime logic (HTTP status endpoint, llama-server
spawn/health-poll/restart-with-backoff, clean shutdown) is identical
bytecode across all three OSes and all four service-registration
mechanisms (systemd unit, launchd plist, Scheduled Task, Windows Service).
Only the "how does this OS keep the wrapping process alive" layer differs,
which is inherently OS-specific and was already isolated in
`aipotluck/installer/service/{systemd,launchd,windows_service}.py`.

A real bug was caught and fixed during the original Linux implementation
that motivated splitting the HTTP server onto its own thread in
`runner.py`: calling `http.server`'s `shutdown()` synchronously from a
signal handler running on the same thread as `serve_forever()` deadlocks
(the shutdown call blocks waiting for the serve loop to notice, but the
serve loop can't proceed until the signal handler returns). Moving the
HTTP server to its own thread means `stop()` can call `shutdown()`
directly and safely from any thread (a signal handler, a pywin32 SvcStop
callback, whatever) without that hazard.

## 4.7 Windows: bootstrapping Python itself

Explicit product requirement: **the Windows installer must check for
Python and install it if missing**, since unlike Linux/macOS, a stock
Windows machine commonly has no Python at all, and the installer itself is
Python.

Two cooperating pieces:

- `aipotluck/installer/python_bootstrap.py` (`find_python()` / `ensure_python()`):
  pure-Python, cross-platform version-checking logic. On Windows, if no
  interpreter >= 3.9 is found, it shells out to
  `winget install --id Python.Python.3.12 -e --silent
  --accept-package-agreements --accept-source-agreements`, then re-resolves
  by probing `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Python\` and `%ProgramFiles%`
  directly (winget does not refresh the current process's PATH). Raises a
  clear, actionable `PythonNotFoundError` with manual-install instructions
  if winget itself is unavailable or fails. On macOS/Linux, `ensure_python`
  only detects and raises an actionable brew/apt/dnf message -- no
  sudo-gated auto-install on those platforms, since they ship Python by
  default in practice.
- `packaging/windows/install.ps1`: the *true* zero-prerequisite Windows
  entry point, since `python -m aipotluck.installer.install` can't run at all
  without Python already present. Plain PowerShell (no dependencies),
  mirrors the exact same find-or-winget-install logic, then hands off to
  `python -m aipotluck.installer.install` with equivalent flags. This is what a
  Windows user (or a future signed .exe wrapper) actually runs first.

`aipotluck/installer/install.py`'s service-registration step also calls
`ensure_python()` itself (not just the PS1 script) before writing the
service's `ExecStart`/`ProgramArguments`/schtasks command line -- so the
service always points at a *validated* interpreter path, not a blindly
trusted `sys.executable`, which matters most on Windows where the
resolved python.exe may have just been installed by winget in this same
run.

STUB STATUS for this whole section: written against documented winget
CLI behavior (`winget install`, silent flags, package ID
`Python.Python.3.12`) and pywin32's public API surface, but **not
exercised on real Windows hardware** -- no Windows host is available in
this environment. Everything downstream of `ensure_python()` returning a
valid interpreter path is the exact same code already tested end-to-end on
Linux.

## 4.8 Public one-line installer layer

Two thin bootstrap scripts at the repo root, meant to be posted publicly
and piped into a shell (`curl ... | bash`, `irm ... | iex`):

- `install.sh` (Linux/macOS): checks for `git`, clones (or updates an
  existing checkout of) the repo into `~/.aipotluck/src`, then execs
  `python3 -m aipotluck.installer.install` with any passed-through arguments. Python
  presence is not checked here -- that's `aipotluck/installer/install.py`'s job via
  `python_bootstrap.ensure_python()`, which already has the right
  per-OS messaging.
- `install.ps1` (Windows, repo root -- distinct from
  `packaging/windows/install.ps1`): checks for `git` (installing it via
  winget if missing, mirroring the Python auto-install pattern), clones
  into `%LOCALAPPDATA%\aipotluck\src`, then hands off to
  `packaging/windows/install.ps1` (the one that finds-or-installs Python).

Both scripts default to the real public clone URL
(`https://github.com/currentai-org/aitpotluck-local-client.git`), overridable via
`AIPOTLUCK_REPO_URL` for a fork or a local mirror -- see README.md's "One-line
public installer" section for exact end-user usage.

No installer logic is duplicated in either bootstrap script -- both are
strictly "get the source, then call the already-tested installer,"
consistent with every other layer in this project reusing rather than
reimplementing.

Verified end-to-end on this Linux/arm64 dev host using a local bare git
repo as a stand-in "public" remote (`file://` URL via
`AIPOTLUCK_REPO_URL`): fresh clone with submodule init, re-run against an
existing checkout (updates via fetch + reset --hard rather than
re-cloning), and the placeholder-URL guard correctly refusing to run
without an override. The Windows `install.ps1` (repo root) is untested
like the rest of the Windows surface (no Windows host available).

## 5. Open questions before implementation

Resolved during implementation:

1. Default install scope: **per-user (no admin), autostart at login** --
   implemented as the default; `--system` is opt-in on all three OS
   backends.
3. GPU backend default: **auto-detect with CPU fallback** -- implemented in
   `platform_detect.detect_gpu_backend`; unknown/unsupported asset
   combinations (e.g. no linux-arm64-cuda release) fall back to the CPU
   asset automatically (`fetch.resolve_asset`).
4. Installer language: **stdlib Python**, confirmed sufficient; no native
   wrapper needed yet.
5. Default model: **no bundled model** -- defaults to a small placeholder
   (`bartowski/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF:Q4_K_M`) fetched via
   llama-server's own `-hf` flag so the service has something to supervise
   out of the box; `--model-hf` / `--model-path` override for real use.

Still open:

2. Should the installer also do a foreground smoke-test run of
   `llama-server` before handing off to the service, separate from the
   supervised background process? (Not implemented -- the supervisor's own
   health-poll-until-healthy on startup serves this purpose today.)

## 6. Non-goals for this phase

- No custom transport layer yet (explicitly deferred per instructions).
- No GUI installer wizard yet (packaging/ is a placeholder).
- No auto-update mechanism yet.
- No support for building llama.cpp from source by default (submodule is
  reference/fallback only, not the default install path).
