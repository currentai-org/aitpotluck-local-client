"""Our own cache of prebuilt llama-server binaries, for hosts/backends upstream doesn't publish.

build_strategy.py already tells us when no upstream release asset is viable -- every Jetson-class
arm64+CUDA board hits this, and a from-source build there takes 30-90 minutes even on a good day
(confirmed live: ~35 minutes at -j3 on a Jetson Orin Nano). Once we've paid that cost once for a
given (os, arch, backend, GPU architecture) combination, there's no reason to pay it again on every
matching host -- we can build the binary exactly once, archive it in the same format as the
upstream release assets, host it as a release on this project's own public repo, and let install.py
check here before ever falling back to a real compile.

Manifest shape deliberately mirrors llama_version.json's assets section exactly (release_base_url +
tag + {key: {file, sha256}}) so fetch.py's existing download_asset/extract_archive/find_binary work
completely unchanged -- this file only adds the KEY RESOLUTION (which entry matches this host),
not a second download/verify/extract implementation.

Key format includes the CUDA architecture (e.g. "linux-arm64-cuda-sm87") where upstream's own keys
never need to, because upstream doesn't publish arm64 CUDA binaries at all -- but our own cache
might eventually hold binaries for several distinct Jetson-class (or other arm64+CUDA) generations
(Xavier is SM 7.2, Orin is SM 8.7, Thor is SM 10.x), and those are not interchangeable: a binary
built for one CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES value will not run (or run correctly) on a different one.
