"""Decide whether to install a prebuilt llama.cpp release asset or build one from source.

Two independent, confirmed-real conditions force a source build -- either is sufficient:

  1. The host wants acceleration (backend != "cpu") but no prebuilt asset was ever published for
     that exact os/arch/backend combination. Every Jetson-class board hits this: it's an arm64
     host that reports "cuda" from detect_gpu_backend (nvidia-smi is real there), but llama.cpp's
     release CI has never published a linux-arm64-cuda asset. Falling back to the linux-arm64-cpu
     asset here (like fetch.resolve_asset does for a bare "no backend match" case) would silently
     throw away the GPU -- so this case is intercepted before fetch.resolve_asset ever runs.

  2. The best available prebuilt asset for this os/arch/backend needs a newer glibc than the host
     has. Confirmed live 2026-09-23: llama.cpp's release CI builds its Linux arm64 assets against a
     newer base image than most arm64 boards run -- the pinned b10989 linux-arm64-cpu asset needs
     glibc 2.38, JetPack 6.2.3 / Ubuntu 22.04 ships 2.35, and the binary refuses to even start
     there. This is a distinct problem from (1): it would still bite an arm64+CPU-only host with an
     old-enough distro, no GPU involved at all.

Neither condition is Jetson-specific in mechanism, even though Jetson boards are the concrete case
that surfaced both of them at once.
