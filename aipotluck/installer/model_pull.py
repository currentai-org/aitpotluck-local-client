"""One-shot Hugging Face model pre-fetch, used by `aipotluck-local-client pull`.

Neither the installer nor the service ever downloads model weights on their own -- the installer
(install.py) only fetches the llama.cpp *binaries*, and llama-server itself lazily downloads
whatever `-hf`/`--model` it's configured with the first time it actually starts (see
service/runner.py's build_llama_server_args). This module exists so a user can trigger that
download ahead of time -- before pairing, or to switch models without waiting through a cold
start -- without reinventing Hugging Face's GGUF-resolution logic (matching a `repo:quant`
shorthand to the right file, split-GGUF handling, etc.). It reuses llama-server's own `-hf`
downloader for that, and only orchestrates around it: spawn on a private ephemeral port, poll
`/health` until the model has actually finished downloading AND loading, then terminate -- the
same "spawn, poll, terminate" shape service/llama_supervisor.py uses for the long-running
service, just run to completion once instead of supervised forever.
