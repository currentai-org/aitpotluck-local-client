"""Platform, architecture, and GPU-backend detection.

Everything here is best-effort and non-fatal: if a probe fails or is
inconclusive, we fall back to a safe default (plain CPU asset for the
detected OS/arch). Detection never raises for a supported OS; unsupported
OSes raise UnsupportedPlatformError with a clear message.
