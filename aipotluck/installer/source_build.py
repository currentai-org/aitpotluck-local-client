"""Build llama-server from source when build_strategy decides no prebuilt asset is viable.

Confirmed viable against a real Jetson Orin Nano (JetPack 6.2.3): a manually-built llama-server
there already links libggml-cuda.so against the JetPack-bundled CUDA 12.6 toolkit at
CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=87 and serves real inference. This module automates exactly that path:
check the host actually has what a build needs (never silently `sudo apt-get install` on the
caller's behalf -- many hosts, including that Jetson, require an interactive sudo password, so a
non-interactive installer would just hang or fail confusingly), check out the pinned tag into the
vendor/llama.cpp submodule, configure + build with resource-aware parallelism, and locate the
resulting binary the same way fetch.py locates one inside an extracted release archive.

The full set of packages this checks for (see missing_apt_packages) was cross-referenced against
llama.cpp's own release CI, not guessed from one host's missing package -- every Linux
build-*.yml/release.yml job (cpu, cuda, vulkan, rocm) was read for its own `apt-get install` line,
intersected with what a native GGML_NATIVE=ON build of just the llama-server target actually needs
(their CI installs several things -- ninja-build, python3-venv, git-lfs, libjpeg-dev -- that are
there for CI's own portable multi-arch/test/conversion-script concerns, none of which apply here;
confirmed libjpeg-dev in particular isn't a real llama.cpp build dependency at all, by checking that
nothing in the CMake tree does find_package(JPEG) -- image loading goes through the header-only
stb_image instead).

Two build-time gotchas are worth a full explanation, both the same shape (a plain, non-REQUIRED
find_package(...) that degrades SILENTLY -- configure still succeeds -- rather than failing loud):

- llama.cpp's HTTPS support (`-hf`/`--cache-list`, which this project's own pull/list commands
  depend on) needs libssl-dev; without it, configure succeeds and the gap only shows up later as a
  runtime error the first time something tries to download a model.
- OpenMP multi-threading on the CPU backend (ggml/src/CMakeLists.txt's `find_package(OpenMP)`)
  needs libgomp1; without it, configure succeeds with only a `message(WARNING "OpenMP not found")`
  buried in build output, and the binary silently falls back to single-threaded CPU inference --
  no error, just much slower than it should be.

Preflight checks for both before ever starting cmake, specifically to avoid either burning a
30-90 minute build on a binary with a silent gap, or only noticing the slowdown/breakage after.
