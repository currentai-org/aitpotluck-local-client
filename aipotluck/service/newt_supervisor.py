"""Supervises the `newt` (Pangolin tunnel client) child process: start,
restart on crash with exponential backoff, and clean shutdown.

Cloned from llama_supervisor.py's shape (same rationale: the OS service
manager supervises this Python process, this class supervises the child
process it owns -- two tiers of self-healing).

  systemd (Restart=on-failure) -> aipotluck_service.py -> NewtSupervisor -> newt

Unlike llama-server, newt has no local HTTP `/health` to poll -- but as of newt 1.17.0 it does
have a real runtime health signal: `--health-file <path>`, which newt writes itself once it has
genuinely established the tunnel. Confirmed live, against a real local Pangolin stack, exactly how
this behaves (not assumed from the --help text):
  - newt actively removes any stale health file at its OWN process startup, before it has
    reconnected -- so a freshly (re)started process never inherits a leftover "ok" from before.
  - Once connected, it writes the literal 2-byte content "ok".
  - It is written ONCE on connect and is NEVER refreshed on later pings, and -- this is the part
    worth stating plainly, because it's the opposite of what the flag name suggests -- newt does
    NOT remove or update it again if an already-established connection later drops. Verified by
    killing the real Pangolin server under a connected newt process: it went straight into its
    own `ERROR:`-logged retry loop while the health file kept saying "ok" from the earlier,
    now-stale connection.

So the health file alone answers "did this process connect successfully at least once since it
started" -- a real, positive, runtime-computed signal, but not by itself "is it connected RIGHT
NOW". That's why tunnel_connected() below combines it with the log-tail check this module already
had: newt's own log keeps emitting a fresh ERROR line for as long as it's genuinely still failing
to (re)connect, so a recent ERROR line is treated as authoritative and overrides a stale "ok" --
the log-tail's role is now specifically that override, not an independent positive claim.
