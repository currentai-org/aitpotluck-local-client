"""Cross-platform Python interpreter detection + best-effort auto-install.

Why this exists: the installer itself is a Python script, so whoever
invokes `python -m installer.install` already has *some* Python. But the
services we register (systemd/launchd/Scheduled Task/Windows Service) all
re-invoke `sys.executable` later, at boot/login, potentially on a machine
where Python was only ever present via a venv that's since been removed,
or (most commonly) a fresh Windows machine with **no system Python at
all** reached via our packaging/windows/install.ps1 bootstrapper rather
than a manual `python -m installer.install` call.

This module is the shared logic behind that bootstrapper:
  - find_python(): locate a suitable interpreter already on the system
  - ensure_python(): find one, or (Windows only) try to install one via
    winget, then re-resolve

macOS/Linux ship python3 in practice on every currently-supported OS
release, so ensure_python() on those platforms only detects and raises a
clear, actionable error -- it does not attempt sudo-gated installs.
Windows is the one platform where "no Python at all" is the common case
for a non-developer end user, so it's the one platform with a real
auto-install path, per explicit product requirement.
