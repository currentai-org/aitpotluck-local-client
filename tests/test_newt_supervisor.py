"""aipotluck.service.newt_supervisor -- the newt (Pangolin tunnel) process supervisor.

The one thing this file exists to pin: tunnel_connected() correctly distinguishes "the newt
process is alive" from "the tunnel is actually connected" -- process liveness alone can't make
this distinction (a real failure this project hit showed newt "running" for 20+ hours while its
own retry loop never once succeeded), and neither can newt's own --health-file taken alone: it's
a real runtime signal (newt writes "ok" once it has genuinely connected) but confirmed live
against a real Pangolin tunnel that it is NEVER refreshed on later pings and -- the important
part -- is NOT cleared if an already-established connection later drops. So a stale "ok" from an
earlier, now-dead connection would read as healthy forever unless something else catches it; the
log-tail check (kept from this module's first pass) is that catch. Real log/health files are used
throughout (not a mocked reader) -- this is exactly the kind of thing a mock could make look
correct while testing nothing.
